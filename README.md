Each folder (wk1,wk2,...,wk10) contains statistical models in R to analyze the impact of education on earnings, test economic theories like the Human Capital Theory, and understand policy implications. 
Through the research I've implemented bivariate and multivariate OLS regressions, handling nonlinearities, interaction effects, and control for dummy variables. 
I've also critically evaluated internal and external validity, drawing lessons from real-world datasets and simulated experiments.
To publish the research we have used the tools such as R Markdown and tidyverse tools for data wrangling, visualization, and reporting.
